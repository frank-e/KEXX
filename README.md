# KEXX
KEDIT macro collection

This is a copy of [purl.net/xyzzy/kex][2011] as it was or should have been in November 2011, i.e., the last known good local `inetput/ftproot/kex` folder content with ***.kex*** (KEXX), ***.kml*** (KEDIT Macro Library), one ***.cmd***, and three ***.zip*** files.

The archived [xedit](https://purl.net/xyzzy/xedit.htm "KEXX Macros") page explains the content. I plan to upgrade this repo to what I use today (2020) *soon* :wink:
